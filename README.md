# Radial_Energy_Method (REM)

This repository provides MATLAB codes for the **radial energy method** (**REM**). 

The energy-based physics-informed neural network (PINN) has opened a new way for computational mechanics and has received great attention in recent years. However, such type of PINN is unstable and can frequently generate unphysical ‘fracture’ failures, which greatly barriers its further applications. 

The codes are for 2D mechanics problems, including:
 - 2D cantilever beam with linear elastic material under the small deformation assumption (**Eq. 15** in the manuscript)
      
 - 2D Cook's membrane with neo-Hookean material under large deformation (**Eq. 30** in the manuscript)  
               
For more details in terms of mathematical proofs and numerical examples, please refer to our paper.
